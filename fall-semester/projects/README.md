Your project should allow a user to log in and then either:
  - create a new story
  - or add a line to an existing story

Alternatively you could have your project have the user create a blog post or add comments to an existing blog post.

Minimum requirements:
  - Hard code a couple of users
  - Have the ability to add a new story or add a line to a story

Extras:
  - Allow for removing a story
  - Allow for removing a line
  - Put in user registration rather than just hardcoded users

Be creative - anything else you can come up with
